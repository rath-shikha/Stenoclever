Stenoclever: A smart Stenographer


We aim to solve the above problem by building a web application which can summarize the text file
generated by speech to text conversion .The software then analyses the text and form
cases out of it. After this it will auto-suggest a few elements and keep records in the
system for future reference of the client meetings and also several other stake holders.
In future this can be more advanced by a self learning algorithm running behind which
will speak instead of just popping up messages.
